# staff_leave_management

I did this project in the final semester of my Btech. This project was done by a group of three members.

So, basically, this project contains three main modules i.e.- Staff, Hod, and registrar/admin. If any staff members need the leave, then they have to ask for the leave and their leave is accepted by Hod first and then by registrar , If Hod or registrar anyone of them cancels the leave then leave gets rejected.
The same is for Hod also, if they want the leave then they have to ask permission from the registrar only.

We have also added various functionality like there were different types of leave and a limited number of leaves to be granted per month, also if there is medical leave then they have to submit the medical proof for that.

The project was done by using Php, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap as frontend and MySQL as backend.
